# Nightvision Toggle

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). It can be downloaded from the [Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-nightvision-toggle).

## Description

Adds a shortcut button and keyboard shortcut (defaults to `Ctrl+;`) to toggle your nightvision equipment on and off. Works with any modded nightvision equipment as well. When you hit the shortcut, any nightvision equipment you have in your armor is disabled and provides no nightvision and consumes no energy. When you hit the shortcut again, any disabled nightvision equipment is restored to its normal state.
